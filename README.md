# NextJS + TypeScript Boilerplate

**There is a way to configure Webpack to parse TS files using the package `@zeit/next-typescript`, but it's not working at the moment (or I havent figured it out). Check branch `webpack`.**

## Usage

* Installation: `yarn install`
* Development Server: `yarn dev:ts` and `yarn dev:next`
* Production Server: `yarn start`
* Static HTML export: `yarn export`
